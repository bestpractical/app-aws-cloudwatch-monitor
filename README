SYNOPSIS
     aws-cloudwatch-monitor [--check <module>]
                            [--from-cron] [--verify] [--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
    "aws-cloudwatch-monitor" collects and sends custom metrics to AWS
    CloudWatch from an AWS EC2 instance.

OPTIONS
    --check <module>
        Defines the checks to run.

        Multiple "--check" options may be defined and are run in the order
        they're passed.

    --from-cron
        Specifies that this script is running from cron.

        "--verbose" is forced to off and results information is suppressed
        if "--from-cron" is set.

        "--from-cron" additionally adds a random sleep interval up to 20
        seconds.

    --verify
        Checks configuration and prepares a remote call, but does not upload
        metrics to CloudWatch.

    --verbose
        Print additional details while running.

    --version
        Print the version.

    --help
        Print the help menu.

CONFIGURATION
    An example configuration file, "config.ini.example", is provided in the
    project root directory.

    To set up the configuration file, copy the example into one of the
    following locations:

    "$ENV{HOME}/.config/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/config.ini"
    "/etc/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/config.ini"

    After creating the file, edit and update the values accordingly.

    NOTE: If the "$ENV{HOME}/.config/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/" directory
    exists, "config.ini" will be loaded from there regardless of a config
    file in "/etc/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/".
