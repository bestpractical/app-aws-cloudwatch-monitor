    CloudWatch

SYNOPSIS

                            [--from-cron] [--verify] [--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
    "App::AWS::CloudWatch::Monitor" is an extensible framework for
    collecting and sending custom metrics to AWS CloudWatch from an AWS EC2
    instance.

    For the commandline interface to "App::AWS::CloudWatch::Monitor", see
    the documentation for aws-cloudwatch-monitor.

    For adding check modules, see the documentation for
    App::AWS::CloudWatch::Monitor::Check.

CONSTRUCTOR
    new Returns a new "App::AWS::CloudWatch::Monitor" object.

METHODS
    config
        Returns the loaded config.

    run Loads and runs the specified check modules to gather metric data.

        For options and arguments to "run", see the documentation for
        aws-cloudwatch-monitor.

CONFIGURATION
    To send metrics to AWS, you need to provide the access key id and secret
    access key for your configured AWS CloudWatch service. You can set these
    in the file "config.ini".

    An example is provided as part of this distribution. The user running
    the metric script, like the user configured in cron for example, will
    need access to the configuration file.

    To set up the configuration file, copy "config.ini.example" into one of
    the following locations:

    "$ENV{HOME}/.config/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/config.ini"
    "/etc/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/config.ini"

    After creating the file, edit and update the values accordingly.

     [aws]
     aws_access_key_id = example
     aws_secret_access_key = example

    NOTE: If the "$ENV{HOME}/.config/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/" directory
    exists, "config.ini" will be loaded from there regardless of a config
    file in "/etc/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/".

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
  AWS CloudWatch limits each upload to no more than 20 different metrics
    AWS CloudWatch will return a 400 response if attempting to upload more
    than 20 different metrics at once.

    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Pu
    tMetricData.html>

    A metrics collection can quickly exceed 20 metrics since each check
    module gathers multiple metrics.

     aws-cloudwatch-monitor --check Process --process apache --process postgres --process master --process emacs --check Memory --check DiskSpace --check Inode --disk-path /
     Failed to call CloudWatch: HTTP 400. Message: The collection MetricData must not have a size greater than 20.

    Until this limitation is worked around in a future release of
    "App::AWS::CloudWatch::Monitor", splitting the checks into separate
    aws-cloudwatch-monitor commands allows the uploads to succeed.
