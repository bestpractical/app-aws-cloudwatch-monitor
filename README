NAME
    aws-cloudwatch-monitor - collect and send metrics to AWS CloudWatch

SYNOPSIS
     aws-cloudwatch-monitor [--check <module>]
                            [--from-cron] [--verify] [--verbose]
                            [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
    "aws-cloudwatch-monitor" collects and sends custom metrics to AWS
    CloudWatch from an AWS EC2 instance.

OPTIONS
    --check <module>
        Defines the checks to run.

        Multiple "--check" options may be defined and are run in the order
        they're passed.

    --from-cron
        Specifies that this script is running from cron.

        "--verbose" is forced to off and results information is suppressed
        if "--from-cron" is set.

        "--from-cron" additionally adds a random sleep interval up to 20
        seconds.

    --verify
        Checks configuration and prepares a remote call, but does not upload
        metrics to CloudWatch.

    --verbose
        Print additional details while running.

    --version
        Print the version.

    --help
        Print the help menu.

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR CHECK MODULES
    The check modules within this project may require additional options not
    directly defined in "aws-cloudwatch-monitor".

    All additional options defined on the commandline are passed to the
    check modules.

    For example, the "DiskSpace" check module requires the "--disk-path"
    option, which is passed through and verified in the check module itself.

     aws-cloudwatch-monitor --check DiskSpace --disk-path /

    If "--disk-path" isn't defined, the "DiskSpace" check module will warn
    and skip gathering it's metrics.

     aws-cloudwatch-monitor --check DiskSpace
     error: Check::DiskSpace: Option: disk-path is required at lib/App/AWS/CloudWatch/Monitor/Check/DiskSpace.pm line 18.

    Additional information about each check module can be found using the
    "perldoc" program. For example, documentation for the included
    "DiskSpace" check module can be read by running the following command:

     perldoc App::AWS::CloudWatch::Monitor::Check::DiskSpace

CONFIGURATION
    An example configuration file, "config.ini.example", is provided in the
    project root directory.

    To set up the configuration file, copy the example into one of the
    following locations:

    "$ENV{HOME}/.config/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/config.ini"
    "/etc/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/config.ini"

    After creating the file, edit and update the values accordingly.

    NOTE: If the "$ENV{HOME}/.config/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/" directory
    exists, "config.ini" will be loaded from there regardless of a config
    file in "/etc/aws-cloudwatch-monitor/".
